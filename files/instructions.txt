The Chinese language has a huge number of 4-character fixed phrases called '成语‘ (cheng yu). They originate from poetry, folk lores, fairy tales and historical events. 

For example: 
一叶知秋: From one leaf, one can tell that fall is here
三心二意: Literally, 'three hearts and two minds', used to describe someone who is fickle or easily distracted
天马行空: Literally, 'a horse walking in the sky', used to describe someone who is imaginative and whose head is in the clouds

It's a wonder what entire stories and ineffable feelings you can pack into these 4-character phrases. 

Learn about some of these phrases in a fun game of matching! Don't worry if you don't know Chinese. You can match identical characters like 
'天马' and '天马' (AB-AB) together, or 
'行空' and '行空' (CD-CD) together.
Chinese speakers or learners would recognize more possible moves as they would be able to match 
'天马' and '行空' (AB-CD) together, or 
'行空' and '天马' (CD-AB) together.
